### üè∑Ô∏é Category search
Prompt Genius categorizes all prompts hierarchically by usage scenario, making it easy for users with different backgrounds and occupations to quickly locate the desired prompts.
Currently includes 9 main categories: research assistance, copywriting, code development, language learning, Microsoft Office usage, leisure and entertainment, academic tutoring, teacher instruction, and gift selection, each with multiple subcategories containing various prompts.

### üåé Language switch

The website defaults to English, as ChatGPT and others have more English training data, making it easier to obtain high-quality results. If you need to use Chinese or other languages, such as Japanese, Korean, German, etc., you can switch languages in the upper right corner of the page.
After switching, the prompts for the new language will be displayed in the current category.

### üì± Multi-device support

The website is optimized for screens of all sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops, and has a fully responsive layout design. Users get a consistent experience across devices.

## Technical Design

The frontend is build with [MDUI](https://www.mdui.org/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

The backend is implemented with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) plus other Python packages (please refer to [requirements](./requirements.txt)).

Huge shout-out to those excellent works. This project would be impossible without them.

### Start the server

```shell
# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Flask server in debug mode.
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_DEBUG=true
flask run --port 9000

# Start the server with waitress for better performance in production environment.
waitress-serve --port=8080 --call app:create_app
```

### Data model and database

Most data of this project, including some element contents, languages, class trees, and prompts are stored in a database.

The data model is defined in [the model file](./app/models.py) based on SqlAlchemy.
Technically, the abstracted model design makes it possible to freely choose various database solutions.

The database server to connect is claimed in [the configuration file](./app/app_config.json). We give an example of using SQLite as the database. It is fully file-based and good for lightwight application like this. If no existing database are given, SqlAlchemy will create a new database file (located in `./instance` directory) with empty tables. You can then add your own data accordingly.

## We thank all the users for their kindly contributions!

@x7peeps: I hope you can act as my academic paper translator. I will talk to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate and answer with a corrected and improved English text. I hope you can use more precise and easy to understand. Please only reply with the translation, do not write an explanation.
